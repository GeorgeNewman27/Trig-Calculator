# Trig-Calculator
In order to practice my Python skills and learn new ones, I am making a plugin for my FX-CG50 graphical calculator that (hopefully) will do a bunch of trigonometric things. I am mainly focusing right now on being able to input the sides and angles of a triangle and having the program work out the rest. 
I hope to later add:
Calculations involving area of triangles
Support for degrees or radians
A way to specify exact answers, or have answers within a set precision
Use complex numbers to expand on the exact capabilities of the program (including a dedicated exact trig value solver later on)
I want to eventually port this to C in order to access the graphing and rendering functions on the calculator (i.e to draw the triangle you are inputting information for in real time).
More? We'll see...
